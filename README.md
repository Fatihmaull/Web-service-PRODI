# Asynchronous Data Fetching Based on Program ID with JSON Parsing

**Description:**
This repository contains code to fetch data from an existing web service using asynchronous programming methods in C#. The code fetches student data based on a specific program ID and includes parsing data in JSON format obtained from the web service.

**Main Features:**
1. **Asynchronous Programming:**
   - Utilizes async/await features in C# to ensure non-blocking data fetching from the web service.
   - Employs libraries such as `HttpClient` for handling asynchronous HTTP requests.

2. **Data Fetching Based on Program ID:**
   - Performs GET requests to the API endpoint provided by the web service, using the program ID to filter the student data.
   - Handles HTTP responses, including status codes and error handling.

3. **JSON Parsing:**
   - Uses libraries such as `System.Text.Json` to parse JSON data obtained from the web service.
   - Processes parsed data for further use within the application.

**Usage:**
1. **Dependency Installation:**
   - Ensure you have included necessary packages, such as `System.Net.Http` and `System.Text.Json`.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Adjust the API endpoint URL and request parameters according to your needs, including the specific program ID.

3. **Running the Code:**
   - Implement the main method to initiate the data fetching and parsing process.
   - Use async/await within functions for data fetching and JSON parsing.

**Purpose:**
This repository is created to provide an example of how to implement data fetching from a web service based on a specific program ID using asynchronous methods and JSON parsing in C#. It aims to assist developers in building responsive and efficient applications that handle network requests effectively.

**Example Usage in C#:**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace AsyncDataFetch
{
    class Program
    {
        static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            string programId = "12345";  // Example program ID
            string url = $"https://api.example.com/students?programId={programId}";
            using HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
            
            try
            {
                HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(url);
                response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
                
                string responseBody = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                var students = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<object>(responseBody);
                
                Console.WriteLine(students);
            }
            catch (HttpRequestException e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Request error: {e.Message}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to perform an asynchronous GET request to a web service using a program ID to filter student data and parse the JSON response in C#.
